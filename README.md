Sorotoki.jl is a daughter project of the Matlab toolkit [Sorotoki](https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode) but written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). Realtime simulation models for soft robots were possible in Matlab (if converted to executable .mex files) but Julia offers the simultaneous advantage of script-based programming and c/c++ equivalent computation speeds using precompilation.
